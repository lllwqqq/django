2020-06-01, Children's Day.

Two days ago, Xiaoman and his grandparents, grandmother, grandmother, father and mother accompanied their first birthday, 1 year old, Happy Birthday!

I also gave up the part-time job of my friend ’s company because of insufficient energy.

I have always wanted to write a website that simply records my life and our story.

I always wanted to insist on writing my own website

Let me start now！
